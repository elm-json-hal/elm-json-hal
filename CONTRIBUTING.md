#### I want to correct a bug

Describe the content of the bug here, or in an issue to reference.

If you create a pull request that fixes a bug, you must add at least one unit test for the bug that shows where it fails with the old version. You may also want to give any references if there is a bug in my implementation (relative to a specification).

#### I want to add a new feature / I want to change the design

Please open and reference an issue describing the intended changes before making the pull request, and include any relevant sources.
